Create a variable for your favorite number (can be a float like 7.5).
Create a variable for your favorite food (a string).
USE an f-string with print() to display a sentence like: "My favorite food is [YourFood] and my favorite number is [YourNumber]."
If your number was a float, try printing it again using an f-string, but format it to display with only one decimal place (e.g., :.1f).
