# Create a variable for your favorite number (can be a float like 7.5).
# Naming convention for indentifiers is snake_case
favourite_number = 2.4555555

# Create a variable for your favorite food (a string).
favourite_food = "toast"

# USE an f-string with print() to display a sentence like: "My favorite food is [YourFood] and my favorite number is [YourNumber]."
print(f"My favorite food is {favourite_food} and my favorite number is {favourite_number}.")

# If your number was a float, try printing it again using an f-string, but format it to display with only one decimal place (e.g., :.1f).

print(f"My favorite food is {favourite_food} and my favorite number is {favourite_number:.1f}.")
